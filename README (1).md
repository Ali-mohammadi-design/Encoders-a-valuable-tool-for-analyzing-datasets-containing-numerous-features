# Encoders: a valuable tool for analyzing datasets containing numerous features

In some cases, datasets may comprise numerous features, posing challenges for analysts to discern meaningful patterns. Encoders, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can address this issue by reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining significant features.
In a specific instance, drawing inspiration from www.pieriandata.com, we examined the average consumption of 17 types of food in grams per person per week across various UK countries. Initially, the dataset appeared overwhelming and rendered it difficult to extract valuable insights. However, employing encoders to reduce the data dimension uncovered notable distinctions in Wales's dietary habits compared to other countries, a discernment that was considerably challenging to attain using the original dataset.



## Workflow
1-Data preparation
2-Training autoencoders
3-Using encoders to reduce data dimension and presenting results


Notes:
In order to effectively reduce data dimension, the use of encoders is essential. However, to ensure the accuracy of the encoder, it is imperative to employ a matching decoder for proper model training. As a result, we implement the training of an autoencoder, while utilizing solely the encoder component for dimension reduction.
